## What is this
A simple app to help with grocery shopping. Intended for easy and fast use, optimized for mobile.

No logins, no ads, no cookies. Just start typing and make a list.

The data is stored in your browser through the `local storage` API. As a result, your list doesn't transfer between devices.

## Features
* Shows you if something you're typing is already on your list
* Suggests items you've bought before once you start typing

Let me know if you want more!
